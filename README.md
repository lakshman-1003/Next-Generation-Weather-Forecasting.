#### Abstract
The growing necessity for precise, fine-grained, and real-time weather predictions has exposed limitations in conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches have gained prominence for their ability to handle complex, nonlinear dynamics of weather systems.  
This survey reviews ML/DL models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/GBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and hybrid models like CNN-LSTM and XGBoost-LSTM. It also examines techniques such as attention layers, physics-aware frameworks, and preprocessing (wavelet transforms, EMD) for improved accuracy.  
Key applications include rainfall forecasting, temperature estimation, flood prediction, and solar radiation modeling. The paper highlights challenges like overfitting, lack of interpretability, uneven data distribution, and cross-regional adaptability.
